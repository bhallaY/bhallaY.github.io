Hi, I'm Yash. I am a computer science and biology student at Northeastern University. I've become motivated to start writing about the books I read and the various large and small coding things I do. You can learn more about me by browsing through this website! 

(For anyone interested, I built this website using [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com) and [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com))
