Hi, I'm Yash. I graduated as a computer science and biology student at Northeastern University in May. 

I am a persistent developer working to use my skills to improve the human condition. My interests lay in full stack web development, distributed computing, and open source development. 

There's a lot to software development and instead of keeping it in my head or in a notebook I inevitably lose, I'm trying to keep it here ðŸ™‚
